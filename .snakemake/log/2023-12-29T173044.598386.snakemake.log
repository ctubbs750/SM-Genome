    * Param outdir is a prefix of input or output file but hardcoded:
      If this is meant to represent a file path prefix, it will fail when running workflow in environments without a shared filesystem.
      Instead, provide a function that infers the appropriate prefix from the input or output file, e.g.: lambda w, input:
      os.path.splitext(input[0])[0]
