Building DAG of jobs...
Your conda installation is not configured to use strict channel priorities. This is however crucial for having robust and correct environments (for details, see https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/tipsandtricks.html). Please consider to configure strict priorities by executing 'conda config --set channel_priority strict'.
Using shell: /usr/bin/bash

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.

Job 4: 
        Checks for installation of gaps. Weird rule, workaround.

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
